## General info

This applications purpose is to find the fastest and most efficient path leading from Bots starting point, going through module in which is the 
container to pick, and finishing in the receiving station. Then it's generating file, in which all above information is contained. To find and generate path I am using Dijkstry's shortest path algorithm, which finds distance between source and selected vertex, also calculating time necessary to transition.

## Technologies

* Java version: 17.0
* Maven version: 4.0
* JGraphT library version: 1.5.1
